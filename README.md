### Running the project

Once you have cloned the repo, install dependencies and run the project in development mode:

```bash
cd table-search-poc
npm install # or yarn
npm run dev
```

Or, via Docker

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

This will start the development server on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). Open it and click around.
